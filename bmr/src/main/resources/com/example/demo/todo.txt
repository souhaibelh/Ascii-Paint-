What I want to do is:

Have a properties file with the settings of my application.

Read the file everytime I open the app, if one of the values is missing,
then add default ones.

Whenever a user changes a Setting id like to updater 2 things:

1- Properties file
2- Text in the screen showing what property is selected

Any idea how to do this without Observer design pattern ? Can I use normal
Property and Bindings of javaFX ?
